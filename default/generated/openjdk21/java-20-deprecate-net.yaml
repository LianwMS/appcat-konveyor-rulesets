  message: |-
    The `java.net.URL` constructors are deprecated in JDK 20 release.

    Developers are encouraged to use `java.net.URI` to parse or construct a URL. In cases where an instance of `java.net.URL` is needed to open a connection, `java.net.URI` can be used to construct or parse the URL string, possibly calling `URI::parseServerAuthority()` to validate that the authority component can be parsed as a server-based authority, and then `calling URI::toURL()` to create the URL instance.

    A new method, `URL::of(URI, URLStreamHandler)` is provided for the advanced usages where there is a need to construct a URL with a given custom stream handler.
