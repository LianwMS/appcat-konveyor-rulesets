  message: |-
    `Thread.stop()` was originally specified to "stop" a victim thread by causing the victim thread to throw a `ThreadDeath`. It was inherently unsafe and deprecated in an early JDK release. The ability to "stop" a thread with `Thread.stop` has been removed and the `Thread.stop` method changed to throw an exception. Consequently, `ThreadDeath` is also deprecated, for removal.
