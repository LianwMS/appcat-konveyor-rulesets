  message: "The application uses Quartz scheduled jobs. Scheduled jobs, such as Quartz
    Scheduler tasks or Unix cron jobs can't be used with cloud service like Azure
    App Service, Azure Spring Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service.\n These Azure services
    won't prevent you from deploying an application containing scheduled tasks internally.\n
    However, if your application is scaled out, the same scheduled job may run more
    than once per scheduled period.\n This situation can lead to unintended consequences.\n
    \n To migrate a Java application that uses scheduled jobs to Azure, you can follow
    these recommendations:\n\n * **Identify scheduled jobs**: Inventory any scheduled
    tasks running on the production server(s), inside or outside your application
    code. Search the application code for references to Quartz, @Scheduled annotation,
    or cron expressions.\n \n * **Remove scheduled jobs**: Remove the scheduled jobs.
    If you need to run scheduled jobs, you can use Azure Container Apps jobs. Azure
    Container Apps jobs allow you to run containerized tasks that execute for a finite
    duration and exit. You can trigger a job manually, schedule their execution, or
    trigger their execution based on events."
