    When migrating an application that relies on the file system to Azure, it's important to consider the limitations of local storage in a cloud environment.
     An application running inside a container could lose access to a file in local storage.

     The following recommendations depend on the function of the file in local storage:

     * **Reading/writing files**: Use Azure Storage services for object, block, and file storage to meet your data's highest demands.

     * **Logging**: Log to standard output and use Azure Monitor to collect and analyze the logs.

     * **Caching**: Use Azure Cache for Redis as a cache backing service.

     * **Configuration**: Store configuration in Azure App Configuration instead of using the file system. Also store configuration settings in environment variables so that they can be updated without code changes.
