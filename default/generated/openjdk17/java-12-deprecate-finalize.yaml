  message: |-
    The `finalize` methods of `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` were deprecated for removal in JDK 9. They have been removed in this release. 
    The `java.lang.ref.Cleaner` has been implemented since JDK 9 as the primary mechanism to close file descriptors that are no longer reachable from `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream`. 
    The recommended approach to close files is to explicitly call close or to use `try-with-resources`.

  message: |-
    The `finalize` method in `java.util.ZipFile`, `java.util.Inflator`, and `java.util.Deflator` was deprecated for removal in JDK 9 and its implementation was updated to be a no-op.
    The `finalize` method in `java.util.ZipFile`, `java.util.Inflator`, and `java.util.Deflator` has been removed in this release. Subclasses that override `finalize` in order to perform cleanup should be modified to use alternative cleanup mechanisms and to remove the overriding `finalize` method.
