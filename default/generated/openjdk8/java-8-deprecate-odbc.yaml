  message: |-
    Starting with JDK 8, the `JDBC-ODBC` Bridge is no longer included with the JDK. The `JDBC-ODBC` Bridge has always been considered transitional and a non-supported product that was only provided with select JDK bundles and not included with the JRE. 
    Instead, use a JDBC driver provided by the vendor of the database or a commercial JDBC Driver instead of the `JDBC-ODBC` Bridge
